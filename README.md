# Waveform4j
A java library for generating waveforms from audio files

Unit tests will not work unless you have run:
1_download_test_wav_files.sh (requires wget on path)
2_create_audiowaveform_json_test_files.sh (requires audiowaveform on path)
If you don't want to deal with this, use "mvn install -DskipTests"
